# Week 1 Discussion Questions


## a. Based on your reading, which statement surprised you? 

I don't know if one statement in particular surprised me because it is all new to me! However, it is very interesting to learn about different languages there are for programming, which I did not know. So what surprised me is how many languages there are and how Python is used today.Â 

## b. Which part of Python language you liked the most? 

I like that it is easy to use and seems to be used in many many places. I'm excited to learn the language and to be able to actually apply it!

## c. Many sources assert that Python is the leading programming language globally, while others suggest it holds the second or third position. Given your research, how would you rate Python, and what are the reasons behind your assessment?

To me, it seems like Python is number one. Based on everything I've read it's the most commonly used even by people who do realize they're using it. People are using apps like Instagram and ChatGPT every day, how can that be beat!
